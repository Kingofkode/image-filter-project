## Installation
1. Download the master branch
2. Open image-filter-project-master/Main/Main.pde

## How to Use the Program
When the program is initially launched, the following window should appear:
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
To begin working, open an image and select an image file from the dialogue box that appears.  
<br/>
The left toolbar contain buttons for the three filters (see [below](#filters) for more). To apply any of the filters, simply click the appropriate button. The buttons for the brush, square fill, and crop tools are also on this side. To use the brush, click the button and drag the cursor across the screen. (Note: The line may be drawn from the center of the brush, not the tip.) To use the square fill or the crop tool, click the button, then select opposite corners of the rectangular region to be edited. Do NOT click and drag; this will not be enough by itself to complete the action.  
<br/>
The right toolbar contains general program functions, including the open button once an initial image has been selected. These functions are all applied by simply clicking the respective buttons.  
<br/>
The bottom toolbar contains a color selection tool for the brush and square tools. The three boxes representing the red, green, and blue values can be tweaked by clicking on them with a mouse. Right-click them to increase the values (up to 255), and left-click to decrease the values (down to 0). The last box mixes the RGB values to preview what the tools will use.

## Getting Started with the UI Library
### Views
Views are the fundamental building blocks the user interface.
Because view objects are the main way the application interacts with the user, they have a number of responsibilities. Here are just a few:
- Views draw content in their rectangular area

- Layout and child view management

- Views may contain zero or more child views.

- Views can adjust the size and position of their child views.

Views can be nested inside other views to create view hierarchies, which offer a convenient way to organize related content. Nesting a view creates a parent-child relationship between the child view being nested and the parent. A parent view may contain any number of child views but each child view has only one parent view. When a child viewâ€™s visible area extends outside of the bounds of its parent view, no clipping of the child view's content occurs. The geometry of each view is defined by its `xPos`, `yPos`, `viewWidth`, and `viewHeight` properties. 

#### Creating a view
The following example creates a 200 x 200 blue view and places its top-left corner at the point (10, 10) in the parent view's coordinate system (once it is added to that parent view). The color was changed to blue in this example. The full list of View's customizable properties can be found [here](Docs/View.md).
```
// Initializes new View object
final View blueView = new View(10, 10, 200, 200);

// Sets background color to blue
blueView.viewColor = color(133, 205, 246);

// Adds blueView to mainView so it is rendered
mainView.addChildView(blueView);

```

### Mouse event handling
The following example modifies the view width when the view is clicked on.
```
 blueView.responder = new MouseResponder() {
    public void isClicked() {
    // Increases view width to 400 when it is clicked on
      blueView.viewWidth = 400;
    }
    
    // All 3 methods must be present even if they are not used
    public void isHovering() {}
    public void buttonDown(Mouse button) {}
  };
```

### Button
A button inherits all of the properties of a view with some added functionality. For example, when you hover over it, the button highlights. The following example creates a 100 x 50 button with the title "Import" and places its top-left corner at the point (10, 10) in the parent view's coordinate system. The `highlightedViewColor` was changed to blue in this example. A full list of Button's customizable attributes can be found [here](Docs/Button.md).
```
// Initializes new Button object
final Button myButton = new Button("Import", 10, 10, 100, 50);

// Changes the highlight color to blue
myButton.highlightedViewColor = color(35, 130, 242);

// Adds it to mainView so it is rendered
mainView.addChildView(myButton);
```

### ImageView
Image views let you efficiently draw any image that can be specified using a `ImageView` object. For example, you can use the `ImageView` class to display the contents of many standard image files, such as JPEG and PNG files. The following example displays a 421 x 258 image of San Francisco loaded from the web and places its top-left corner at the point (10, 10) in the parent view's coordinate system.
```
// Initializes new ImageView object
final ImageView myImageView = new ImageView("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/San_Francisco%2C_California._June_2017_cropped.jpg", 10, 10, 421, 258);

// Adds it to mainView so it is rendered
mainView.addChildView(myImageView);
```

The picture presented in the `ImageView` can be changed by accessing its `photoPath` property. The `photoPath` property is a string that represents either an online URL to an image or the name of a locally stored image.
#### Applying filters to ImageView
The following example applies a mosaic filter to the aforementioned ImageView. A full list of available filters can be found [here](Docs/Filters.md).

`myImageView.applyFilter(MOSAIC);`

## Tools
In addition to the three filters, the following tools can be used to modify the images.
### Undo and Redo Buttons

## Reflection
To implement the features necessary for this project, we decided to first develop a small library to create the various features we would need, such as `View` and `Button`. This allowed the user interface to easily be made uniform, and it ensured the necessary features (such as recognizing when a mouse clicked a button) were always included. We then developed the filters in separate programs to test them on images in a streamlined environment; they were then imported into the program. The undo/redo functions were then added and checked to make sure they worked even when multiple filters were applied.  
<br/>
The tools were added once the filters were completed. The brush tool came first; when it was first implemented, the color was always set to white for simplicity. The square tool was implemented next (with the color always set to white as well); its method for determining which pixels had been selected was used for the crop tool as well. Finally, the color selector was added, and the color variable was inserted into the code for the brush and square tools.  
<br/>
During the course of this project, several major issues were encountered during the coding process. They included the following:
- To make the program look professional, we decided to make the program run at full screen. However, since different computers have different resolutions, no variables regarding position could be hard-coded; everything had to be set relative to the dimension of the screen. While this was not necessarily difficult, it was tedious and made the code more complex.
- The undo/redo functionality relies upon an `ArrayList` storing different images to keep track of the various edits that have been made. To make this work, though, we had to figure out how to manuever through the array, account for varying image sizes from the crop tool, and delete the correct images when a new filter or tool was applied to the image (otherwise, clicking 'Redo' may have advanced the program to another image when it should not have). The errors were particularly important to work out here because bugs in this code would lock up the program completely.
- The brush tool required a system for relating the mouse's position on the screen to the pixels in the image, which was particularly challenging for resized images. The variables `shrinkRatio1` and `shrinkRatio2` were ultimately introduced to keep track of the effect of the rescaling. However, to check if the pixels were close to the mouse, each pixel in the entire image had to be systematically checked. This system works, but it is inefficient and can cause the brush to lag, resulting in imperfect lines. This area would be a focus of any future development projects.
